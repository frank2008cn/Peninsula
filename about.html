      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <p class="brief">
        Welcome to Peninsula Youth Sports Access (PYSA). We are dedicated to building a positive and inclusive sports community. Our story revolves around two fundamental objectives that drive our mission:
      </p>      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p><b>Accessible and Affordable Sports Training for All:</b> At PYSA, we are deeply committed to providing accessible and affordable sports training to young athletes. Our program is designed to ensure that children from diverse backgrounds have the opportunity to develop their skills and pursue their passion for the sport. Beyond skill enhancement, we place a strong emphasis on fostering friendship and teamwork among our participants, creating a supportive and collaborative environment that goes beyond the court.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Empowering Local High School Athletes:</b> A core part of our mission is to empower local high school athletes by offering them community service and leadership opportunities. By taking on roles as mentors and coaches in our program, these players not only contribute to the development of young athletes but also enhance their own leadership skills. We believe in the transformative power of mentorship and its ability to create positive impacts within the community. At PYSA, we see mentorship as a reciprocal journey, bringing benefits to both mentors and mentees.</p>

              Hi, Allen Rankin here. I've been playing basketball since the 3rd grade and love all aspects of the game. I played for Gunn (either JV or Varsity) for all of high school and played on several travel teams, including Ken Morgan's (a Wooden disciple) Peak Basketball. Additionally, I made the Gunn JV and Varsity tennis teams despite only learning to play the game at the end of my Freshman year. I believe in a strong focus on fundamentals, especially on the defensive side of the ball, along with making it FUN! I'm currently attending college in Wyoming, but will return to the Bay Area to coach basketball as often as I can. I hope that I have a chance to coach your child and instill in them the same joy that I have for the game!

              Hi everyone! My name is Jonathan and I am a basketball coach here with PYSA. 
              I grew up in the South Bay and went to K-12 school in Palo Alto. I have over 
              15 years of playing experience, and have played/coached for 
              various clubs and organizations ranging from the elementary level all the
              way to the collegiate level. Outside of basketball, I recently graduated from
              Johns Hopkins University and am pursuing a medical school education. Still,
              teaching basketball is something that I enjoy very much, and have been
              doing as a side job for over 6 years now. I look forward to training the

              sports for the opportunity to exercise and bond with
              teammates. When I’m not volunteering or taking photos, I use my

              avid sports enthusiast and former Girl Scout.
